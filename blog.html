            <!-- Question number 1 -->
            <div>
                <!-- Question -->
                <h4 class="mb-3">What is the difference between Local storage and Session storage?</h4>
                <p class="fw-bold me-2">Ans: </p>
                <!-- Answer -->
                <p>The one major difference between Local storage and Session storage is the expiration date. <br>
                    <span class="fw-semibold">Local Storage</span> persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
                    <span class="fw-semibold">Session storage</span> is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.

            <!-- Question number 2 -->
            <div>
                <!-- Question -->
                <h4 class="mb-3">What is the difference between Global Scope and Block Scope?</h4>
                <p class="fw-bold me-2">Ans: </p>
                <!-- Answer -->
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-semibold">Global Scope: </span>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. <br>
                    <span class="fw-semibold">Block Scope: </span> Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

            <!-- Question number 3 -->
            <div>
                <!-- Question -->
                <h4 class="mb-3">How does javascript event loop works?</h4>
                <p class="fw-bold me-2">Ans: </p>
                <!-- Answer -->
                <p>
                    The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. <br>
                    The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack. The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.

            <!-- Question number 4 -->
            <div>

                <!-- Answer -->
                <p>There are many waya you can get undefined. Some are - </p> 
                <p>1. If the variable is not initialized it will give undefined</p>
                <p>2. If the function has no return you will get undefined</p>
                <p>3. If a parameter is not passed you will get undefined</p>
                <p>4. If the property is not in the object and you want to get the property you will get undefined</p>
